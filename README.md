# Classification of Malware Dataset (Microsoft Kaggle 2015) Using Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains one of the models developed as part of our bachelorâ€™s final-year research thesis, focused on classifying malware classes from the 2015 Microsoft Kaggle challenge. Various models, including ANN, CNN, and autoencoders, were trained and fine-tuned. Additional results were achieved using transfer learning with the VGG16 model.
